###Project Description
The iOS Calculator project is a straightforward calculator app built for iOS using UIKit and in architecture MVVM, with an emphasis on a clean, intuitive interface and reliable functionality. 
This application allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as other operations such as percentage calculations and toggling between 
positive and negative numbers. It will be good practice to try use MVVM. 

The project builds in 14 Pro, Se, 11 and in other devices.

###Installation
No additional libraries or dependencies are required to run this project. To get started, follow these simple installation steps:

Clone or download the project from GitHub.
Open the project in Xcode.
Build and run the app on your preferred iOS device or simulator.


###Usage
Upon launching the app, you'll be greeted with a user-friendly calculator interface that includes the following key features:

**Calculator Modes**

Calculator Mode: The default mode allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations by tapping on the numeric buttons and operators.
Basic Arithmetic Operations

Addition (+): Tap the "+" button to add numbers.
Subtraction (-): Tap the "-" button to subtract numbers.
Multiplication (x): Tap the "x" button to multiply numbers.
Division (รท): Tap the "รท" button to divide numbers.
Additional Functions

Percentage (%): Calculate percentages of numbers with a single tap.
Positive/Negative Toggle (+/-): Quickly switch between positive and negative numbers for more versatile calculations.
Dynamic User Interface

The calculator's interface is designed for ease of use, with dynamic button styling and layout adjustments to enhance user experience.
Display

The result of your calculations is displayed in a clear and easily readable format on the screen. 


**Helper**
I add the buttons in collectionView. Collection View contains view and label. Button settings we can see in the model Buttons, where we set background color, titles.
IIn the file CalculatorViewControllerViewModel we can see all logic of the calculator (functions of every button and func which updates view). 
In the CalculatorController we have all UI elements, here we designed the project: add collectionView, result Label and set them.

###Contribution
Contributions to this project are highly encouraged! You can contribute in various ways, including:

Code refactoring and organization.
Adding new features or improving existing ones.
Enhancing the user interface for a more visually appealing design.
Testing and error handling to ensure the app's robustness.
